Hi, I'm Ronan, and I am currently working as a software developer at [Scott Logic](https://www.scottlogic.com/) in Edinburgh.


I graduated from [Heriot-Watt University](https://www.hw.ac.uk/) in June 2018 and was delighted to receive Honours of the first class in my BSc Computer Science degree. Since June 2017, I have been a member of the [STEM ambassadors](https://www.stem.org.uk/stem-ambassadors) - a voluntary organisation that aims to promote and encourage the education of STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) in schools and I love getting involved with their events when I can. 

I am a positive, hardworking individual and in my spare time I like to keep fit by going to the gym and playing 5-a-side football. I also enjoy reading, socialising with friends, visiting new places and experiencing new things. At home I enjoy playing the PS4 and watching Netflix.


I am a keen learner, with one of the benefits of my current role being that I get to work with a variety of technologies and this means I am learning new things every day. Some of my favourite areas of study in computer science so far have been artificial intelligence, database management and web development. The aim of this website is to show off some of my achievements and to describe my experience in more detail than would be possible on a CV.
