# Ronan Smith - Personal Website

This is a new version of my old website (https://github.com/RonanS96/devblog). I felt that it was time to modernise it a bit by migrating to HTML5 (React) and to change it's purpose a bit. It is now more of a personal website than a "development blog".

The latest deployed version can be found at:
https://ronanjsmith.com

## Development

This is a React app. All dependencies and packages can be installed by running `yarn install`.


It can be run locally by running `yarn start`.

And it can be built locally using the `npm run build` command.

This is a personal project, but opinions on how I can improve the site are always welcome.
